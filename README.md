SURFS-UP

PROJECT SUMMARY & BACKGROUND:

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, 
he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, 
in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

RESOURCES :

•	Data Source: SurfsUp_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb named later as SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb

•	Data File: hawaii.sqlite

•	Software: Matplotli 3.2.2, Python 3.9, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0, Anaconda 4.8.5, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4, Pandas, Numpy, Sqlalchemy.

WHAT YOU'RE CREATING:

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

1.	Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June.

2.	Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December.

3.	Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis .


 
RESULTS:


After creating and running the datasets for the June and December data the below images are the results:
   
•	The minimum temperature for June was 64° and the min for December was 56° which is an 8° difference between the midpoints of the year.

•	The maximum temperatures for June was 85° and December was 83° degrees respectively.

•	The mean temperature for the June was 74.94° and December was 71.04°.



SUMMARY: 


	Based on our Data Analysis, Data Provided, we can state as a high-level summary of results that Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75 in December, 

making a 0.5 difference between both seasons. Both of these months frequently have tempertures in the 70s.
 
Both June and December show promising temperatures for  icecream parlor business,

 December's minimum temparature (56 F) indicates that it can be cold enough to discourage outdoor activity, 

however the similar mean and maximum temperature  indicates that there is enough fluctuation in the temperature to encourage it on certain days.

In addition, current data provide attributes such precipitation and others, with two queries that our analysis pursue, 

performing weather data for June and December that helps results to decide how we would like to build the shop 

and what areas would make this location attractive to visitors to stop by and have a successful business.
